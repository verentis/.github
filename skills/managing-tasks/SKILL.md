# Managing Tasks

A **task** is a named command the user can run from the Tasks control in the toolbar and you can run with `run_task`. Tasks are declared in `tasks.json` files — plain configuration, nothing generated, nothing in the designer model. Editing one is an ordinary file edit with `read_file` / `write_file` / `patch_file`.

Do this work yourself; there is no model change and nothing for the Software Factory to generate.

## Two scopes, two files

| Scope           | File                                        | Holds                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solution**    | `<workspaceRoot>/tasks.json`                | Tasks that belong to the repository as a whole — a full build, the test suite, a dev-server watcher. |
| **Application** | `<application's tasksDirectory>/tasks.json` | Tasks that belong to one application — build just it, run just its tests.                            |

Both appear together in the solution shell's Tasks strip (solution tasks first, then the active application's, with a divider between). In the **Agents shell** only the solution scope exists — a conversation there is pointed at a folder, not an application — so a task you want available to every agent conversation in a repository belongs in the solution file.

**Get both paths from the workspace context, never by guessing:**

- The workspace root is the `workspaceRoot` on any `availableTasks` entry whose `scope` is `solution`. When there are none yet, it is the repository root the conversation runs in — the `codebaseRoots` entry with `isWorkspaceFolder: true`, or the folder the shell tools resolve `.` to. Confirm with the shell (`ls <root>`) before writing.
- An application's directory is that application's `tasksDirectory` in `applications`. It is **not** its `outputLocation` — those differ in most solutions, and writing to the output location produces a file nothing reads.

**Pick the scope deliberately, and say which you chose.** A command that runs at the repository root (`dotnet build MySolution.sln`, `npm test` in a single-package repo) is a solution task. A command scoped to one application's folder is an application task. When it is genuinely ambiguous, ask — the wrong file is invisible until someone wonders why the button isn't where they expected.

## The schema

`tasks.json` is a single object with one `tasks` map. Keys are task names; each name must be unique **within its file** (the same name in both scopes is fine — they stay separate buttons). `//` and `/* */` comments and trailing commas are accepted.

```json
{
    "tasks": {
        "build": {
            "label": "Build",
            "icon": "fa-cogs",
            "command": "dotnet build",
            "workingDirectory": ".",
            "aiAutoFix": { "enabled": false, "errorParser": "dotnet" }
        }
    }
}
```

| Field              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `label`            | What the button says. Keep it 1–2 words — the strip is horizontal and must not wrap.                                                                                                   |
| `command`          | The command line. Required, **except** on a compound task (one with `dependsOn`).                                                                                                      |
| `icon`             | A Font Awesome 4 class, e.g. `fa-cogs`, `fa-flask`, `fa-play`, `fa-eye`. Defaults to `fa-terminal` (`fa-tasks` for a compound). Only the idle icon — status replaces it while running. |
| `workingDirectory` | Relative to **this file's own folder**: the workspace root for a solution task, the application's folder for an application task. Defaults to `.`.                                     |
| `hidden`           | `true` keeps the task off the toolbar while leaving it runnable as a compound's child and by `run_task`.                                                                               |
| `aiAutoFix`        | `{ "enabled": true, "errorParser": "dotnet" \| "generic" }` — on failure, starts a conversation to fix it. See the limits below.                                                       |
| `dependsOn`        | Child task names — makes this a **compound** task.                                                                                                                                     |
| `dependsOrder`     | `"parallel"` (default) or `"sequence"`.                                                                                                                                                |
| `isBackground`     | `true` for a command that never exits (a watcher).                                                                                                                                     |
| `readyPattern`     | Regex over a background task's output; the first match means "up and watching".                                                                                                        |
| `errorPattern`     | Regex marking a background task's build as failed.                                                                                                                                     |
| `beginsPattern`    | Regex marking the start of a background task's (re)build cycle.                                                                                                                        |

### Compound tasks

`dependsOn` launches several tasks in one container tab with a sub-tab per child.

```json
"watch all": {
    "label": "Watch all",
    "dependsOn": ["watch web", "watch api"],
    "dependsOrder": "parallel"
}
```

- A compound resolves `dependsOn` **within its own file only**. A solution `watch all` cannot name an application's task, and vice versa — the child must live beside it. If you need both, define the child in each file or promote the whole group to the solution scope.
- **Nesting is supported**: a child may itself have its own `dependsOn`, to any depth. A dependency reached from more than one place (e.g. three watchers that all `dependsOn: ["install"]`) resolves to a single run — it starts once and every dependent waits on that same run, not three separate installs racing each other. A genuine cycle (`a` depends on `b` depends on `a`) is rejected with an error naming the cycle, rather than deadlocking.
- Every task reached via `dependsOn` (at any depth) needs a `command` — except the top-level compound itself, which may omit one to be a pure grouping alias (see `watch all` above).
- A compound may ALSO have a `command` of its own; it then runs **after** every `dependsOn` child has completed, and is skipped if any of them failed (VS Code's `dependsOn`-then-run semantics). This applies at every level, not just the top: a nested task with both `dependsOn` and a `command` runs after ITS OWN dependencies, then unblocks whatever depends on it in turn.
- Mark children `"hidden": true` when they exist only to be run by the compound (their own, or an ancestor's).

### Background / watch tasks

A watcher never exits, so it needs to say when it is _ready_ rather than _done_. Without a `readyPattern` a background task counts as ready the moment it spawns — which means a `sequence` advances past it before it has built anything, and `run_task` reports success for a build that hasn't happened.

```json
"watch web": {
    "label": "Watch web",
    "command": "npx tsc -w",
    "isBackground": true,
    "readyPattern": "Found \\d+ errors?\\. Watching for file changes",
    "errorPattern": "error TS",
    "beginsPattern": "Starting incremental compilation",
    "hidden": true
}
```

- `readyPattern` gates `sequence` advancement and is what `run_task` waits for.
- `errorPattern` surfaces errors as soon as they appear — including _before_ the task first becomes ready, so a watcher whose initial build fails shows as erroring rather than starting forever.
- `beginsPattern` scopes errors to one build cycle, which is what lets a watcher recover after a failed build. Without it a watcher that once failed cannot tell a later successful build from the old one and stays flagged. **Set it whenever you set `errorPattern`.**
- Patterns are JSON strings holding regexes, so backslashes are doubled (`\\d`, `\\.`). Take the pattern from the tool's **real output** — run the command once with the shell tools and copy a line from it. A guessed pattern that never matches is the single most common way a watch task ends up permanently "starting".

### Error parsers and AI auto-fix

`aiAutoFix.errorParser` picks how failure output is condensed for the tooltip and for a fix conversation: `"dotnet"` keeps MSBuild `error CODE:` diagnostics, `"generic"` applies a broad heuristic. The parser only ever _adds_ a hint — `run_task` still returns the full terminal tail either way, so a crash whose cause the parser drops is still visible to you.

Two limits worth knowing before you set `"enabled": true`:

- Auto-fix does not apply to **AI-initiated** runs. When you call `run_task` the failure comes back to you in the tool result, so a fix conversation would just duplicate the loop you are already in.
- Auto-fix does not apply to **solution** tasks. A fix conversation is created for an application, and a solution task has none — such a task simply stays failed, with its output on the tooltip and in its tab.

So `aiAutoFix` is for a human clicking the button on an application task. Leave it `false` unless the user asks for it.

## Running and verifying

**Never claim a task works because the JSON parses.** Both shells watch these files and reload within ~200ms of a save, so verification is immediate:

1. `run_task` it. Pass `applicationId` for an application task; pass that task's `workspaceRoot` for a solution task (`availableTasks` reports `scope` and `workspaceRoot` per task — copy the value, don't construct a path).
2. Read the exit code **and** the output. A task can exit 0 having done nothing — a `workingDirectory` pointing at the wrong folder often does exactly that.
3. For a background task, check it reported ready rather than timed out, and that the `readyPattern` matched the line you expected. `run_task` defaults `stopWhenReady: true`, which gives you a one-shot verdict instead of leaving a watcher running; pass `false` only when the user wants it left up.

A task that has not been run once is a task you have not tested. Say so plainly if you could not run it (no shell available, a command needing credentials) rather than reporting it done.

## Editing safely

- **Patch, don't rewrite.** `patch_file` on the one task keeps the user's comments, ordering and formatting; a `write_file` of the whole document silently drops all three.
- **Read before you write.** The file may not exist — check first, and create it with the full `{ "tasks": { ... } }` wrapper rather than a bare map.
- **Renaming a task loses its state, not its history.** The toolbar keys per-task status by name, so a rename reads as "the old task vanished, a new one appeared". Any running session keeps its own tab either way.
- **Removing a task that is currently running** leaves its terminal tab alive until it exits. That is deliberate; don't kill it to tidy up unless asked.
- Keep the task set small and the labels short. This is a toolbar, not a script library — a repository with fifteen buttons has a strip nobody can read, and the toolbar collapses to a dropdown when it runs out of room.
